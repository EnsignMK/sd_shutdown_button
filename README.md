# update
12-08-23:  automatically closing the tab feature
             - however it's important  do this:  
                - whenever you start the webui and you see  the public url
                ![image](https://github.com/EnsignMK/sd_shutdown_button/assets/91480302/2193381f-ae8b-4cd7-965d-be2e9bb29663)
               
                keep ctrl (control) pressed and click on the link. 
                Now the new feature should be working.


           or add the  --autolaunch   argument

 ## potential issue: 
 If the tab doesn't close no worries, it's a browser thing.Your webui is shutdown.
